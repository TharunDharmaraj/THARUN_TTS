00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,760
Yeah, with all those hypersonic missiles everyone's been making, it's about heck in time.

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,700
Maybe Canada will finally start making its NATO military spending agreements.

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,300
This man sees everything coming now.

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
