00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,240
What is she saying?

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,540
You are not taking part in the competition?

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,180
I don't think I can make it. 

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,580
But you have been practicing for a whole month.
And you play so well.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,880
I have never heard anyone play guitar as good as you.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,380
Do you think so?

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,580
I know so.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,020
Let me tell you a story of a boy,ramu, who did what nobody thought he could do.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,820
Once there were two boys, ramu and raju,who lived in a village near Oldenberg.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:02,940
ramu was six years old, while raju was ten.They were very close friends and spent most of their time together.

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,080
One day, as an adventure, they went a little too far away from the village.

12
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,240
and while they were running around and exploring, raju fell into a well.

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:29,780
He started screaming, because he didn't know how to swim and thought he would drown and die.

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,860
ramu panicked and looked around for help, but, there was no one to help them.

15
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,800
Then, suddenly he saw a bucket tied to a rope lying nearby.

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,280
Without wasting any time, ramu threw the bucket into the well and asked raju to hold it.

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:02:01,760
raju held the bucket. ramu started pulling up the rope.He kept pulling and pulling until raju was out of the well.

18
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,960
They were happy and cheering each other.

19
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,900
And they ran quickly towards their home.

20
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:31,760
When they told their families and the villagers about the event,,,nobody believed them... because, ramu was too young and weak to even lift a bucket full of water.

21
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,800
Hence, nobody believed that he could have pulled raju out from the well.

22
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,000
But, only Uncle somu believed them.

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,600
Uncle somu was an old and experienced man whom the villagers took seriously.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,660
So, they asked him how could this be possible?

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,180
Uncle somu laughed and said, "what is there to explain? .The boy is already telling you how he did it.""

26
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,360
He threw the bucket inside and pulled the rope to save his friend.

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,140
What is strange here is how did he manage to gather so much strength???

28
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,260
This was because at that time there was nobody to tell him that he couldn't do it.

29
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,806
Even he himself was not in a position to think.

30
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,800
So, he added the only one who can empower you is yourself.

31
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,000
In fact, you can do it, if you think you can do it.

32
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,820
The villagers realized then how important it is to believe in yourself.

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,700
Do you now believe you can? 

34
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,900
Yes...Yes,,, I can. I can. Grandma.
