# You can add as many sections for langauges as you need. Just add to the number in the [LANGUAGE-#] for each one
# Each section must contain the synth language code, synth voice name, and translation target language
# A value for synth_voice_gender only matters if the service requires it, like Google TTS, but the setting must be there even if not used
